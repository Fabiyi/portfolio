        What is rendering?

        Rendering, in web development, is the process of converting code into viewable, interactive web content. This involves interpreting the code written in languages like JSX or Vue.js and displaying it as a webpage that users can interact with. This can be done server-side or user-side.
        
        Developers often integrate platforms like Sanity with frontend frameworks that utilize server-side rendering to transform components and structured content into visually engaging websites, thereby enhancing the user experience and site performance.
        
        When leveraging server-side rendering, components are converted into HTML strings on the server before sending them to the browser. This approach, combined with the structured content from Sanity, improves time-to-content performance and search engine optimization (SEO), ensuring that the websites are not only visually appealing but also performant and discoverable.
